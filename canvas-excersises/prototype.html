- Create a new class called EmailList. The constructor function should take in one parameter, "name", and return an instance which contains the following:

- name, the name of the mailing list, such as "BSSA Students" or "BSSA Teachers".

- list, an array of all the emails in that list. Note that initially, the array will be empty.

- Add a function to the EmailList's prototype. This function should be called "addEmail", and it should take one parameter, an email address and add it to the "list" property of the instance.

- Add another function to the EmailList's prototype, called "sendEmailToAll". This function should take in one parameter: the text of the email, and then "send an email to each address". Since that lecture will be sometime in week 6, for now, simply print out the following:

"Email content:"
<list the text of the email to be sent>

"Sending email to:"
<list all email addresses>
